# NLP: AI vs Human Text Classification

This Natural Language Processing (NLP) project focuses on classifying text as either written by a human or generated by artificial intelligence. 
It was developed using Python in a Google Colab and includes data preprocessing, tokenization, lemmatization, and classification 
using machine learning models such as Naive Bayes and Random Forest.

## Problem Statement

**Objective:** Classify input text as generated by a **human (0)** or by **AI (1)**.

**Dataset:** [AI vs Human Text Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shanegerami/ai-vs-human-text/data?select=AI_Human.csv)  
**Target variable:** `label`  
- `0` - Human-written text  
- `1` - AI-generated text
